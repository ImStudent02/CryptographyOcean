Caesar Cipher App Developer Manual

Welcome to the Caesar Cipher App Developer Manual! This guide provides an overview of the project structure, technologies used, and dependencies employed in the development of the Caesar Cipher App. Let's dive in:

Project Overview:
The Caesar Cipher App utilizes the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for implementing cryptography functionalities. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.

Project Structure:

Backend (server.js): The backend of the Caesar Cipher App is built using Node.js and Express.js. It handles encryption, decryption, and API connections for data transmission between the frontend and backend.

Frontend (React Project): The frontend of the Caesar Cipher App is developed using React.js. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with encryption and decryption functionalities.

Dependencies Used:

React Router Dom (v6.23.1): React Router Dom facilitates client-side routing within the application, enabling seamless navigation between different components based on the URL.

Axios (v1.7.0): Axios is employed as a promise-based HTTP client for making AJAX requests. It simplifies the process of sending asynchronous HTTP requests and handling responses, making it ideal for interacting with APIs in the Caesar Cipher App.

Getting Started:

Clone the project repository from the source.
Navigate to the project directory.
Install dependencies using npm or yarn: npm install or yarn install.
Start the backend server: node server.js.
Start the frontend development server: npm start or yarn start.
Access the Caesar Cipher App in your browser at the specified URL (typically http://localhost:3000).
